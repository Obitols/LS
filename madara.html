            <p>Madara had four younger siblings but lost all of them at the hands of members of the Senju clan. When
                Madara was a young child, he became friends with Hashirama Senju, both of them were not aware of their
                clans. They shared their dream of establishing peace in their war-inflicted era. Once their father
                became aware of their friendship, they had to go on their separate ways. Eventually, Madara became the
                leader of the Uchiha clan.</p>

            <p> Madara and Hashirama joined forces and established the Hidden Leaf Village and introduced the concept of
                Hidden Village to the world. Madara eventually cut his ties with the Uchiha clan and the Hidden Leaf and
                went on a journey to establish a peaceful world of dreams by Infinite Tsukuyomi. He manipulated many
                individuals and sacrificed a lot of things to create his dream world.</p>

            <p>In the Fourth Great Ninja War, he became the Ten-Tails Jinchuriki and successfully activated Infinite
                Tsukuyomi. Everything was going according to his plan, but he was betrayed by Black Zetsu and was used
                as the vessel for the revival of Kaguya Otsutsuki. As the battle between Team 7 and Kaguya concluded,
                all the tailed beasts were extracted, and Madara died as the Jinchuriki of a tailed beast died after
                their tailed beast is extracted.</p>

        <p>In the Third Great Ninja War, he came across a young Uchiha, Obito Uchiha, who was badly injured. He saved
            the young boy’s life, replaced his lost limbs with Hashirama’s cells, and placed a Forbidden Individual
            Cursed Tag in his heart if Obito decided to betray him. He then started brainwashing Obito for his plans.
            Madara manipulated the Hidden Mist Village to kidnap Rin Nohara, Obito’s love interest, and seal the
            Three-Tailed Beast within her. He orchestrated it in such a way that Rin was forced to be killed at the hand
            of KakashiHatake, Obito’s best friend, in front of his eyes. Obito was overwhelmed with grief and despair by
            the sight and decided to help Madara envision his dream. </p>

        <p>In his battle against the Five Kage, he mentioned it was unnecessary to use his full potential and asked the
            Kages which adult goes all out against mere children. As he valued strength, he was degusted of weakness.
            Above all, he hated a weak Senju. Madara spent his life against the Senju, mostly against Hashirama Senju,
            who was in a league of his own no matter what jutsu he tried. He was disgusted by Tsunade Senju as he
            considered her weak despite the fact that she belonged to the Formidable Senju clan and was a descendant of
            Hashirama Senju.</p>

        <p>In the Fourth Great Ninja War, Madara was revived as a reincarnated shinobi by KabutoYakushi. Madara noticed
            that he was not fully revived but decided to play along. He engaged in the battle against the Allied Shinobi
            Force and the Five Kage. He tested their limits and even the limits of his reincarnated body. When the Edo
            Tensei no Jutsu was released, Madara surprised everyone by releasing himself from the binds of this Jutsu.
            Later, as he realized it was time to meet up with Obito and proceed with his plan, he annihilated the Five
            Kage and joined up with Obito.</p>
