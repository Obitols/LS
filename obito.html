            fan-favorite manga and its anime adaptation, the Naruto series that is written and illustrated by Masashi

            squad consisting of Kakashi Hatake, Rin Nohara, and himself led by Minato Namikaze. Although his abilities
            may have faded in comparison to Kakashi in his early years as a shinobi, he surpassed his predecessors on
            many levels during his prime.Obito was believed to have died in the Third Great Ninja War but he was rescued
            by Madara Uchiha, also known as the Ghost of the Uchiha. After he witnessed the death of Rin, his love

            <p>Obito was born as a member of the legendary Uchiha clan of the Village Hidden in the Leaves. Obito lived
                with his grandmother in his early years but other than that, information regarding his parents and
                immediate family are still shrouded in mystery.</p>

            <p>At the Five Kage Summit, Obito declared war on the world, the Fourth Great Ninja War, after the Five Kage
                declined to peacefully hand over Naruto Uzumaki and Killer B, the jinchuriki of the Nine-Tailed and
                Eight-Tailed Beast respectively. In the war, Obito revived the Ten-Tails and eventually became its
                Jinchuriki.</p>

            <p>Obito's hair turns completely white once he is transformed into the Ten-Tails' jinchuriki and gained an
                Otsutsuki-like appearance. His skin turns white, ten protrusions—five near his shoulders, five near his
                hips—appear from his back,and nine smaller ones grouped in rows of three below it—appear on his back in
                a black array.</p>

        <p>At some point, Team Minato participated in the Chunin Exams where Obito was defeated by Might Guy in the
            third round. Later, Kakashi defeated Might Guy and was promoted to chunin and received Rin’s admiration. To
            gain Rin’s praise and attention, Obito trained rigorously and eventually got promoted to chunin himself, but
            his excitement soon ended when Kakashi got promoted to jonin.Obito had now lost faith in the cruel world
            they lived in, where a pure soul like Rin had to die at the hands of her friend.</p>

    <div class="friend">
        <p>Kakashi instructed Obito to leave Rin behind as completing the mission was more important than concerning
            themselves with Rin’s well-being. Obito was furious at the thought of abandoning Rin and insisted they
            concentrate on her rescue. Obito walked out by himself after Kakashi refused, stating that a shinobi who
            abandons his comrades is worse than scum.To his surprise, he was saved by Kakashi who was moved by his words
            and changed his mind. Unfortunately. Kakashi lost his left eye trying to defend Obito.</p>

            Obito had a rough start in his journey to be the strongest shinobi. He managed to graduate from the Hidden
            Leaf Ninja Academy and became a member of a genin squad. This genin squad consisted of Obito, Kakashi, and
            Rin, captained by Minato Namikaze.
            In the anime, the newly formed genin squad had to go through the bell test. Obito was unable to acquire the
            bell on his own but later succeed in retrieving one by joining forces with Rin and Kakashi and learning the
            importance of teamwork. </p>
