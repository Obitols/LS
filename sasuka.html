        <p>Sasuke Uchiha was born in the prestigious Uchiha Clan in Fugaku and Mikoto Uchiha’s home, with Itachi Uchiha
            as his elder brother. He was named after Sasuke Sarutobi, in the hopes he would follow in his footsteps and
            grow up to be a strong shinobi. As soon as Sasuke was accepted into the academy, he proved himself to be an
            outstanding student but did not receive the acknowledgment he deserved as he was constantly compared to his
            genius elder brother, Itachi, who was considered to be a prodigy. He was forced to live under his older
            brother’s shadow. Sasuke admired Itachi but this made him resent his elder brother to some extent.</p>

            <p>Sasuke graduated and became a part of Team 7 led by Kakashi Hatake, alongside Sakura Haruno and Naruto
                Uzumaki, who later became his rival. Sasuke was filled with a vengeance with a goal to kill his elder
                brother and revive the Uchiha Clan, but as he spent time with his team on their numerous missions, he
                stopped feeling alone and the feeling of vengeance started fading away.</p>

            <p>After Sasuke eliminated Orochimaru, he formed a team of unique individuals. He gathered Jugo, Karin
                Uzumaki, and Suigetsu Hozuki and formed Hebi. The goal of Hebi was to locate Itachi Uchiha and make sure
                no one interrupts Sasuke and Itachi’s battle once they locate him.</p>

            <p>In the new era, Sasuke travels across lands and protects the Hidden Leaf from the shadows, as a gesture
                of atonement for the sins he committed in the past. He married Sakura Haruno and fathered a child,
                Sarada Uchiha. He is also the master of the protagonist of the Boruto series and the son of Naruto
                Uzumaki, Boruto Uzumaki.</p>

        <p> Naruto was assigned to Team 7 consisting of Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno, led by Kakashi Hatake,
            a jonin of the Hidden Leaf Village. In their first C-rank mission, Naruto headed to the Land of Waves to
            protect a bridge-maker, Tazuna. Later, it turned out to be a B-rank mission as Tazuna was being chased by
            Zabuza Momochi, the Demon of the Hidden Mist. Sasuke used his Sharingan and suppressed the fox. Sasuke was
            about to use a fatal attack when he was stopped by Orochimaru and they retreated.</p>

        <p>Sakura was assigned to Team 7 upon graduating the Academy. She showed disappointment at Naruto being her
            teammate but is immediately overjoyed after hearing Sasuke was a part of her team as well. She makes an
            attempt to connect with Sasuke by expressing her envy of Naruto’s paternal status but Sasuke merely takes
            offense and calls her unpleasant. While Sakura searches for Sasuke to see if she can assist him, Naruto is
            busy battling Kakashi. During her hunt, Kakashi encounters her, and uses the delusion that Sasuke has died,
            defeats her with Sasuke and Naruto also defeated in a similar manner.</p>

        <p>Sasuke was successful in locating Itachi and headed out to battle Itachi at the Uchiha Hideout. Sasuke fought
            Itachi and after many hardships, he came out victorious, fulfilling his quest for vengeance after Itachi
            fell on his knees and died at the end of the battle. After his battle, Sasuke was exhausted and fell right
            beside Itachi’s corpse.
            He was then retrieved by Tobi and brought to a safe location. There, Tobi revealed himself to be the
            legendary shinobi, Madara Uchiha (later revealed to be Obito Uchiha) and told Sasuke the truth about Itachi.
