        <p>Itachi was the first born of Fugaku and Mikoto Uchiha, and he was born during an era of conflict. He was only
            four years old at the time of the Third Great Ninja War. One day, Fugaku took young Itachi to a battlefield
            where he witnessed mountains of corpses who died in the war. Fugaku took him to the battlefield to
            familiarize his son with the cruel life of a shinobi. He there saw a shinobi of the nation asking for some
            water. When he tried helping the wounded shinobi, he attempted to kill Itachi after he saw his ninja
            gear.Witnessing such a brutal scene traumatized young Itachi and he became a pacifist. He then decided to
            become a strong ninja capable of eradicating all conflicts and unnecessary bloodshed from the ninja world
            and bringing peace and stability. To achieve his goal, he started training himself ruthlessly.</p>

            <p>He soon got accepted into the Ninja Academy based on his exceptional skills when he was six years old. He
                excelled in all fields at the academy and was recognized as his generation's best. After just four
                months at the academy, his teachers decided to let him take the graduation exam early based on his
                advanced skills that could match the skill level of a genin. He graduated from the academy at the age of
                7.</p>

            <p>Itachi was promoted and became a member of Anbu Black Ops. He was the youngest Hidden Leaf shinobi to
                achieve Anbu status. He was given a position in Team Ro, an elite Anbu force directly under the command
                of the Hokage of the Hidden Leaf. He served as a member of Team Ro and collaborated with Tenzo (Yamato),
                and Kakashi Hatake assumed the role of their captain.</p>

                Itachi left the village after the Uchiha Clan Massacre and enlisted in the Akatsuki, an organization he
                saw as a danger to the Hidden Leaf. The criminal group Akatsuki was made up of misfit ninjas with
                special skills from different hidden villages. The ultimate objective they aimed toward was global
                dominance.

        <p>In his final confrontation with Sasuke, Itachi reveals the secret of the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan. He then
            battles and makes Sasuke exhaust all of his chakra. As Sasuke is out of chakra, he is now unable to suppress
            Orochimaruâ€™s chakra and he takes over Sasuke. Itachi then seals Orochimaru with his Sword of Totsuka.After
            Itachi successfully seals Orochimaru, he then approaches Sasuke, knowing that Sasuke is now out of danger
            and he was successful in protecting his younger brother. Itachi succumbs to his illness and injuries and
            dies with a smile on his face.</p>

        <p>He was later accused of killing Shisui by his fellow clan members. He lost his composure and attacked them.
            At this point, Itachi lost all hope in his clan, who just focused on their clan and lacked the insight to
            look at the big picture. He later meets his father in the Naka Shrine, where Fugaku tells him about the
            Uchiha Stone Tablet and reveals his Mangekyo Sharingan to Itachi. In order to protect the peace in the town
            and prevent the clan from degrading the Uchiha name, he decided to exterminate the Uchiha Clan. He consented
            to this task provided his younger brother Sasuke Uchiha would be protected and cared for.</p>

        <p>When he was five years old, Mikoto gave birth to Sasuke Uchiha and Itachi became a big brother. In the
            Nine-Tails Attack on the Hidden Leaf, Itachi was home alone, taking care of Sasuke. He then protects Sasuke
            and recuses his mother from falling debris, and in the anime, he looks for shelter with Izumi Uchiha after
            saving her life.This incident caused a rift between the leaders of the village and the Uchiha Clan. Hidden Leaf leaders,
            except HiruzenSarutobi, considered this the doing of the Uchiha Clan, as the Sharingan is capable of
            controlling the Nine-Tailed Fox.</p>
